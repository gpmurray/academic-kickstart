My dissertation pairs 12 months of fieldwork in India, with novel administrative
data collection, and rigorous causal analysis to understand the continued success of criminal
politicians in India.

Currently, over 40% of Indian Members of Parliament face a criminal charge. Despite intense political
competition, candidates facing criminal charges are routinely elected across India at higher rates than clean
candidates. My dissertation, Do Criminal Politicians Deliver? Evidence from India, asks why voters elect
“criminal” politicians. Once elected, how do criminal politicians perform? To answer these questions, I
construct a novel dataset detailing the criminal histories, wealth, and electoral results of all state legislative
candidates in India since 2003 (N = 83,000). To measure criminal politicians’ performance, I combine the
candidate dataset with original data on the geo-locations of over 20 million local public works projects
from India’s largest anti-poverty scheme (NREGS).

Overall, I find criminal politicians underperform in office. To provide an alternative explanation for their electability, I
draw on semi-structured interviews from 12 months of fieldwork. I argue that criminal politicians’ access
to money, muscle, and networks provides a comparative advantage in personalized constituency service
that voters prioritize over local public goods. My dissertation represents the first study of how criminally accused politicians fare in relaying state resources
to their constituents and helps clarify a puzzling and troubling trend in Indian politics. At the same
time, I contribute to our understanding of clientelism, the delivery of anti-poverty programs, and why violent
politicians win elections.
