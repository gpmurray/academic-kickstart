# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Broadly, my work is in comparative politics with a regional focus on India. I study how corruption and
criminal elements impede (or facilitate) public service delivery and how politicians’ personal characteristics
shape governance strategies. In particular, I research how criminal politicians influence the delivery
of India’s largest anti-poverty program. Methodologically, I’m interested in combining qualitative fieldwork with causal inference using observational and spatial data.
